# EduTrack
The Edutrack is a College Management System with a simple and efficient application designed to manage key academic entities such as Students, Teachers, Courses, and Departments.
It provides a clean and interactive dashboard interface (HTML/CSS/JS) for demonstration and integrates with a Java-based console backend for data operations.

This project showcases how academic data can be efficiently handled using structured programming and user-friendly design â€” making it perfect for beginners and portfolio demonstrations.
